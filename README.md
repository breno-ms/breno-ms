# Hello, GitHub!
<p>I am a dedicated back-end software developer with a focus on delivering high-quality software solutions. Currently, I work at DBC Company, offering my expertise to Arezzo&CO. My technical proficiency is centered around PHP 8.0, Laravel 9, SQL, Oracle Database, Redis, Git and Docker. These tools are essential in my role, where I am responsible for both maintaining and enhancing an internal management system for Arezzo. This particular system plays a crucial role in automating product replenishment and managing financial planning processes. My professional repertoire includes extensive experience with RESTful APIs, adherence to SOLID principles, and a thorough understanding of design patterns, which are instrumental in developing scalable and maintainable software systems. I am committed to the practices of continuous delivery and am well-versed in the Scrum framework, ensuring that project management and software development processes are both agile and efficient.</p>
