# Hello, GitHub!
<p>Hello! I am a Computer Science student and a self-taught Web Developer. Currently, I am studying technologies related to the JavaScript ecosystem, such as ReactJS, NodeJS, and mainly NextJS. I am looking for my first opportunity in software development, either in an internship position or as a junior developer, to put into practice everything I have studied so far, contribute to the success of projects, and, above all, learn from more experienced developers.</p>
