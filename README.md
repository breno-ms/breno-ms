<h1> Hello, GitHub</h1>

<h3>Personal information</h3>

<p>My name is Breno and I'm a Computer Science Student at Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (UNISINOS).
I live in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I'm mostly into back-end development using Java, Spring Boot and MySQL. Also, I know a little about front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and React. Furthermore, I have interest in functional programming and I'm always willing to learn new programming languages and technologies. I'm looking forward to gain experience on fullstack development and land on my first job.</p>
